Question: Car Racing Game (OOP)

Specifications:
You are asked to implement a car racing game between two players.

- Each car has three properties:
  - name → string
  - speed → number (default: 100)
  - fuel → number (default: 100)
- The game is turn-based.
- On each turn:
  - Cars consume 10 fuel to move.
  - Speed may be randomly increased by a boost item (+20 speed) or decreased by a trap item (-20 speed).
- The race continues until one car runs out of fuel.
- The winner is the car with the highest distance traveled.

Requirements:

Create two classes: Car and RacingGame

1. Car class

- Properties:
  - name: string
  - speed: number = 100
  - fuel: number = 100
  - distance: number = 0

- Methods:
  - move(): void → decrease fuel by 10, increase distance by speed.
  - useItem(item: { speed: number }): void → adjust speed by item effect.
  - showStatus(): string → return "Car A (Speed => 120, Fuel => 80, Distance => 300)".

2. RacingGame class

- Constructor:
  constructor(car1: Car, car2: Car)

- Methods:
  - getRandomItem(): { speed: number }
    - Possible items:
      - { speed: +20 } (boost)
      - { speed: -20 } (trap)
      - { speed: 0 } (nothing)
  - start(): void
    - Game flow:
      1. Show both cars’ status.
      2. Give each car a random item.
      3. Both cars move.
      4. Repeat until one car’s fuel ≤ 0.
      5. Compare distances → show winner.
